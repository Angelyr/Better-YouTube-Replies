# Better YouTube Replies
This extension makes YouTube replies easier to follow. First it sorts the replies based on how many likes the comment has. Then it organizes the replies into threads that make it easy to see who is replying to who. In addition, it adds buttons into these threads to allow users to hide and show conversations so that they can get to the conversations that they want to read.

# Defects
1.  Can not create threads properly when author changes their name or reply gets deleted
2.  Replies only load 10 at a time so it takes a while to load large reply threads
3.  Many users do not use reply button so you can not tell who they are replying to
4.  Buttons are updated at an interval instead of detecting DOM change
5.  Page lags slightly when loading large reply threads
