# Better YouTube Replies
This extension makes YouTube replies easier to follow. First it sorts the replies based on how many likes the comment has. Then it organizes the replies into threads that make it easy to see who is replying to who. In addition, it adds buttons into these threads to allow users to hide and show conversations so that they can get to the conversations that they want to read.
